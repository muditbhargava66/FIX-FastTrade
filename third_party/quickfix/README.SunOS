I was able to get the 64 bit version of QuickFIX library to compile on Solaris 10 (sparc) with workshop 12.3 compiler.
Unit tests do not compile so these were disabled. 

Example script:

#!/bin/sh

./bootstrap

CC=cc CXX=CC CFLAGS=-m64 CXXFLAGS=-m64 LDFLAGS=-m64 configure --prefix="Your prefix"

make && make install
